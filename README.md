# Lecture Tools

a python package for delivering interactive lessons via a jupyter notebook or share via reveal.js, currently it makes a reveal presentation

<!-- To use this package, you write a lecture or activity using markdown or jupyter notebooks.

Then in a notebook you can:
- as instructor read in a lesson and display it slide by slide in a prespecified order or in a different order by calling slides by name
- as a student read in a lesson and get worksheets to follow along in class and take notes both on your own and with instructor guidance

The command line tools  allow you to:
- parse a notebook into .py files to use with load magic
- generate the student repo from the class prep repo


The class prep repo will include:
- markdown files of lesson to be presented like slides
- complete jupyter notebooks

The student repo will contain:
- lesson snippets as markdown files
- .py files with runnable code excerpts
- .py files with fill in the blank slots -->
